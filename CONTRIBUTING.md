# Setting up your dev environment

## Step 1: Make a clean strapi installation

More details on this can be found in [strapi's documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html)

## Step 2: Fork this repo

Hit fork on GitHub so have your own copy of this repository.

## Step 3: Clone your fork of the repository into the project

Git clone your fork into `plugins/preview-content` of your development strapi project. By default, git names the folder `strapi-plugin-preview-content`, so rename it to `preview-content` (or specify the folder name while cloning).

## Step 4: Set up the plugin

To install its dependencies, head into the folder:

`cd plugins/preview-content`

and install:

`yarn install`

## Step 5: Run your project with hot reload

In the `plugins/preview-content` folder run:

`yarn build -w`

This will start the typescript compilation with automatic relaoding.

After the first successful compilation, run strapi in the root of your project:

`yarn develop --watch-admin`
