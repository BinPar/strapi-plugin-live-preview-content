A plugin for [Strapi Headless CMS](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) that provides content preview to integrate with any frontend:

This is what the plugin looks like when editing content:

This is what the plugin looks like when we are in list view:

<img src="public/assets/example2.png" alt="Example of buttons in list view" />

### üñê Requirements

Complete installation requirements are exact same as for Strapi itself and can be found in the documentation under <a href="https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/installation/cli.html#step-1-make-sure-requirements-are-met">Installation Requirements</a>.

**Supported Strapi versions**:

- Strapi v3.4.x

**We recommend always using the latest version of Strapi to start your new projects**.

### ‚è≥ Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install strapi-plugin-preview-content

# yarn
yarn add strapi-plugin-preview-content
```

### üìÅ Copy required files

Inside `strapi-files` we have a list of folders with the Strapi version, enter to the version that correspond with your installation, and you will see this files

Copy the folder named `content-manager` inside your `<project-root>/extensions` folder

### üëç Active content type as previewable

To enable content type to be previewable and see preview, or clone entry, you've to add option previewable to true in a configuration json file (`*.settings.json`):

```json
{
  {...}
  "options": {
	{...}
    "previewable": true
  },
  {...}
}
```

### üöÄ Run your project

After successful installation you've to build a fresh package that includes plugin UI. To archive that simply use:

```bash
# npm
npm run build && npm run develop

# yarn
yarn build && yarn develop
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è Usage

Go to Settings > Preview Content

<img src="public/assets/settings.png" alt="Preview Content Settings" />

Here you can configure how your url for frontend preview, at the moment there are only two parameters

`:contentType` The content type to query
`:id` The id of content to query

For example in NextJS you can make use of [serverless functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to make an URL like this:

`http://localhost:3000/api/preview/:contentType/:id`

And put the logic there to render content
